SAMPSON MONASTERY STUDY
undirected adjacency matrix 
  -  18 vertices (monks)
  -  60 edges ("like" relations - in the top 3 friendship rankings)

BACKGROUND 
  -  Sampson recorded the social interactions among a group of monks while resident as an experimenter on vision, and collected numerous sociometric rankings. The labels on the data have the abbreviated names followed by the codings used by Breiger and Boorman in all their work. During his stay, a political "crisis in the cloister" resulted in the expulsion of four monks (Nos. 2, 3, 17, and 18) and the voluntary departure of several others - most immediately, Nos. 1, 7, 14, 15, and 16. (In the end, only 5, 6, 9, and 11 remained). All the numbers used refer to the Boorman and Breiger numbering and are not row or column labels. Hence in the end Bonaventure, Berthold, Ambrose and Louis all remained.
