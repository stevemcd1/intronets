## FRATERNITY SOCIAL NETWORKS (LONGITUDINAL)

- **Dataset Name:** Fraternity Social Networks (Longitudinal)
- **File:** frat_graphs.rda
- **R Objects:** frat_i (list of igraph objects)
frat_n (list of igraph objects)

### Background

This dataset contains longitudinal social network data from a fraternity, capturing evolving social ties across 15 observation waves. Two parallel lists of igraph objects are provided -- frat_i and frat_n -- representing the same network under different construction or filtering conditions (e.g., different tie definitions or inclusion criteria). Each list element is named by wave (frat0 through frat15, with frat9 absent), allowing analysis of how network structure changes over time within a bounded social group.

Each wave captures a directed network of 17 individuals. The longitudinal structure makes this dataset particularly useful for studying tie formation, dissolution, and the dynamics of small-group cohesion.

## GENERAL SOCIAL SURVEY 2004 (SURVEY)

- **Dataset Name:** General Social Survey
- **File:** gss.rda
- **R Objects:** gss (data frame)

### Background

The General Social Survey (GSS) is one of the longest-running and most widely used social surveys in the United States. This file contains data from the 2004 wave, including responses from 1,467 survey respondents across 122 variables.

A central feature of this dataset for social network analysis is the name generator module: respondents were asked to identify up to five people ("alters") with whom they discuss important matters. For each alter listed, the survey collected information on tie strength, relationship type (e.g., spouse, parent, sibling, coworker, friend), and the extent to which alters know each other. Additional name interpreter variables capture alter characteristics including age, education, sex, race, religion, and political party identification.

This dataset is particularly associated with debates about trends in American social isolation: McPherson et al. (2006) reported a dramatic shrinkage in core discussion networks between 1985 and 2004, a finding subsequently critiqued by Fischer (2009) as potentially artifactual.

See also: gss_ego.rda for the ego network reformatting of this data.

## GENERAL SOCIAL SURVEY 2004 (EGO NETWORK DATA)

- **Dataset Name:** General Social Survey Ego Networks
- **File:** gss_ego.rda
- **R Objects:** ego (data frame)
alterlong (data frame) gr.list (list of igraph objects — alter networks only) gr.list.ego (list of igraph objects — ego + alters)

### Background

This file is a restructured, ego-network-ready version of the 2004 General Social Survey (see also gss.rda). The raw GSS survey matrix has been converted into a set of ego network objects suitable for direct use in igraph-based analyses. A total of 288 egos have at least one named alter and are included.

Four objects are provided to support different analytical approaches:

- **ego:** Data frame of 288 ego respondents with demographic attributes.
- **alterlong:** Long-format data frame (955 rows) of alter-level attributes,
one row per alter, linked to ego by ego_id.

- **gr.list:** Named list of 288 igraph objects, one per ego. Each graph
contains only the alters and their inter-connections (alter network without ego node).

- **gr.list.ego:** Named list of 288 igraph objects, one per ego. Each graph
includes the ego node connected to all alters, plus alter- alter ties (full ego network with ego included).

This structure supports both aggregate ego network analysis (e.g., average density across all egos) and individual-level inspection of specific ego networks.

## GITHUB DEVELOPER COLLABORATION NETWORK

- **Dataset Name:** GitHub Developer Collaboration Network
- **File:** github.rda
- **R Objects:** github (igraph)

### Background

This dataset represents the collaboration network among software developers employed at one large (anonymous) technology company, as observed through their activity on GitHub. Nodes are individual developers; edges reflect co-contribution to shared code repositories (i.e., two developers are linked if they both committed code to at least one common repository).

The network is a one-mode projection of an underlying two-mode (bipartite) person-by-repository network. Edge weights reflect the number of shared repositories between any two developers, making this a valued network. Not all developers form a single connected component; a component attribute identifies which connected subgraph each node belongs to.

- **Data Collection:** GitHub activity logs, January 2018 to February 2021,
extracted via the GHTorrent project.

- **Domain:** Computational Social Science / Software Engineering /
Organizational Networks

### Network Structure

## GRIME MUSIC ARTIST-TRACK NETWORK

- **Dataset Name:** Grime Music Artist–Track Network
- **File:** grime.rda
- **R Objects:** artist_track_adj (matrix)
artist_track_edge (data frame)

### Background

This dataset captures the bipartite (two-mode) network connecting Grime music artists to the tracks on which they have appeared. Grime is a genre of electronic music originating in East London in the early 2000s, characterized by rapid collaboration and frequent guest appearances across tracks. A tie exists between an artist and a track when that artist contributed to the recording.

The data are provided in two complementary formats:

- **artist_track_adj:** A 372 x 391 binary adjacency matrix (artists as rows,
tracks as columns). Suitable for matrix operations and bipartite projection.

- **artist_track_edge:** An edge list data frame (1,143 rows) with columns for
artist name and track name. More readable and suitable for graph construction.

This bipartite structure can be projected into either a one-mode artist-artist network (two artists linked if they share a track) or a one-mode track-track network (two tracks linked if they share an artist).

- **Data Collection:** Compiled from publicly available discography and music
database sources for Grime genre recordings.

- **Domain:** Cultural Sociology / Music Studies / Bipartite Networks

### Network Structure

- **Network Type:** Two-mode (bipartite), undirected
- **Directed:** No
- **Weighted:** No (binary co-appearance)
- **artist_track_adj:** 372 artists x 391 tracks (matrix)
- **artist_track_edge:** 1,143 artist–track co-appearance ties (edge list)

## JOB DESCRIPTION WORD NETWORK (TEXT)

- **Dataset Name:** Job Description Word Network
- **File:** jobdescnet.rda
- **R Objects:** jobdescnet (igraph)  — Job title-to-word network
jobtitlenet (igraph) — Job title-to-job title network jobwordnet (igraph) — Word-to-word network

### Background

These data were scraped with permission from the USAjobs database. The original file contains all of the available federal job postings for the US in the summer of 2021. This file is a subset based on a single representative job ad from 15 of the most popular job titles in the database.

The two mode job title-to-word network (jobdescnet) was sliced to include only instances where edge weights exceeded 2 (and isolate words removed) in order to reduce the total number of words and the overall density of the network.

jobdescnet is a two mode network representing the linkages between those 15 ads and 784 common words appearing in those job ads. jobtitlenet is a one mode network showing connections between job titles based on word co-occurrance. jobwordnet is a one mode network showing the connections between words based on presence in multiple job ads.

## KRACKHARDT HIGH-TECH MANAGERS

- **Dataset Name:** Krackhardt High-Tech Managers
- **File:** hi_tech.rda
- **R Objects:** hta (igraph) — Advice network
htf (igraph) — Friendship network htr (igraph) — Reports-To network

### Background

These data were collected from the 21 managers of a high-technology equipment manufacturer on the west coast of the United States (total company size: just over 100 employees). Three distinct types of directed relational data were collected:

- **hta (ADVICE):** Each manager identified colleagues they go to for advice.
Directed: A → B means A seeks advice from B.

- 21 nodes | 190 edges
- **htf (FRIENDSHIP):** Each manager identified colleagues they consider friends.
Directed: A → B means A names B as a friend (asymmetric).

- 21 nodes | 102 edges
- **htr (REPORTS_TO):** Formal organizational hierarchy, extracted from company
documents. A → B means A reports to B.

- 21 nodes | 20 edges
All three networks share the same node set and attribute table, enabling direct comparison of formal structure (htr) with informal networks (hta, htf). This multiplex design makes the dataset ideal for studying the alignment (or misalignment) of formal and informal organizational structure.

## MORENO CLASSROOM SOCIOMETRY

- **Dataset Name:** Moreno Classroom Sociometry
- **File:** moreno.rda
- **R Objects:** moreno (igraph)

### Background

This dataset contains Jacob Moreno's classic sociometric data collected from a classroom of 33 children. Moreno is widely credited as the founder of sociometry — the systematic measurement of social preferences within groups — and this dataset is among the earliest and most cited examples of social network data in the history of the field.

Edges represent mutual friendship or positive social nominations between students. The network captures the informal social structure of the classroom, including popular children (high degree), isolated children (low degree), and clique formations. Gender is recorded as a node attribute, enabling analysis of gender-based segregation in children's peer networks.

This is an undirected network — ties are treated as symmetric regardless of directionality of the original nominations.

- **Data Collection:** Sociometric surveys administered to a classroom of children;
early-to-mid 20th century. Collected by Jacob L. Moreno.

- **Domain:** Developmental Psychology / Sociometry / Classic SNA

### Network Structure

- **Network Type:** One-mode, undirected, binary

## PADGETT FLORENTINE FAMILIES MARRIAGE NETWORK

- **Dataset Name:** Padgett Florentine Families Marriage Network
- **File:** ifm.rda
- **R Objects:** ifm (igraph)

### Background

This dataset captures the marriage alliance network among 16 prominent Florentine families during the early 15th century (circa 1430). The data were collected by John Padgett from historical documents and have become one of the most widely used networks in social network analysis pedagogy and research.

Nodes represent family aggregates (not individuals); an edge between two families indicates that they were linked by at least one recorded marriage alliance. The network is symmetric — if Family A married into Family B, the tie is undirected.

Substantively, the data capture a pivotal political struggle for control of Florence, with two dominant factions: one centered on the Medici family (node 9) and one on the Strozzi family (node 15). The Medici's strategic use of marriage ties — including bridging across otherwise disconnected families — is often cited as a key factor in their political rise.

Node attributes provide economic and political context: net wealth (1427), civic council seats held (1282–1344), and total marriage/business ties across the broader dataset of 116 families.

- **Data Collection:** Historical documents; Renaissance Florence, circa 1430.

## SAMPSON MONASTERY NETWORK

- **Dataset Name:** Sampson Monastery Network
- **File:** sampson.rda
- **R Objects:** sampson (igraph)

### Background

Samuel Sampson collected data on social interactions among novice monks at a New England monastery during a period of significant internal conflict, while he was in residence as an experimenter studying vision. The dataset captures positive friendship ("liking") ties, derived from the top-3 nominations in the final wave of sociometric rankings (SAMPLK3), and has become one of the most frequently analyzed networks in social network analysis research and pedagogy.

During Sampson's residence, a political crisis within the monastery led to the expulsion of four monks (Nos. 2, 3, 17, and 18 in the Boorman & Breiger coding) and the voluntary departure of several others (Nos. 1, 7, 14, 15, and 16). Only four monks ultimately remained: Bonaventure, Berthold, Ambrose, and Louis (Nos. 5, 6, 9, and 11).

Node attributes record each monk's faction membership (Loyal Opposition, Young Turks, Outcasts, or Waverers) and whether they were part of the original pre-crisis cohort (cloisterville). These faction labels, developed by Breiger, Boorman, and Arabie, are used extensively in the blockmodeling literature.

- **Data Collection:** Sociometric rankings collected at three time points (SAMPLK1–3)
during residency at a New England monastery, 1960s. This network reflects SAMPLK3 (final wave, top-3 nominations).

## STATE OF THE UNION WORD NETWORK (TEXT)

- **Dataset Name:** State of the Union Word Network
- **File:** sotunet.rda
- **R Objects:** sotunet (igraph) — President-to-word network
sotupresnet (igraph) — President-to-president network sotuwordnet (igraph) — Word-to-word network

### Background

Based on the raw text from State of the Union (SOTU) Addresses from American presidents. Collected via the 'sotu' package in R. Collapsed to include the first SOTUs from 15 selected presidents. Words include only nouns from those speeches.

The two mode president-to-word network (sotunet) was sliced to include only instances where edge weights exceeded 7 (and isolate words removed) in order to reduce the total number of words and the overall density of the network.

sotupresnet represents the one mode projection of sotunet showing the connections between presidents on the basis of similar noun usage.

sotuwordnet represents the one mode projection of sotunet showing the connections between words on the basis of similar utterance by presidents.

## COUNTRIES TRADE NETWORKS

- **Dataset Name:** Countries Trade Networks
- **File:** tradenets.rda
- **R Objects:** mg (igraph) — Manufactured Goods trade network
f (igraph) — Foods trade network c (igraph) — Crude Materials trade network m (igraph) — Minerals & Fuels trade network d (igraph) — Diplomatic Exchange network trade_attr (data frame) — Country-level attributes

### Background

This dataset contains five directed network matrices representing economic and diplomatic relations among 24 countries, selected by Wasserman and Faust (1994) from a larger dataset of 63 countries compiled by Smith and White (1988). The selection was designed to be geographically, economically, and politically representative of the global system.

Four trade networks capture the flow of different commodity types — manufactured goods, food and live animals, crude materials (excluding food), and minerals and fuels. A fifth network captures diplomatic exchange (mutual ambassador placement) among the same countries. In all networks, a directed tie from country A to country B indicates that A exports the relevant commodity to (or exchanges diplomats with) B.

An attribute data frame provides macroeconomic context for each country: population growth, GNP growth, secondary school enrollment, and energy consumption — all measured circa 1970–1981.
